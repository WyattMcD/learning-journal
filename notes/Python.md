# Python Notes  
**Date:** 2025-08-04

## Key Concepts

- Control flow: `if` / `elif` / `else` 
**Definition:** Branches your code so different blocks run based on Boolean conditions.
- `for` loops with `range()`
**Definition:** Iterates a block of code a specific number of times.
- `while` loops and loop counters
**Definition:** Repeats code as long as a condition remains true.

## Code Snippets
```python
# control_flow.py

# Example 1: if/elif/else

...
count += 1
